# Plastic Classification with 4-Channel 1D CNN (PyTorch)

## Overview

This project implements a **1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN)** in **PyTorch** to classify plastic types using **NIR/SWIR spectral data**.

Each sample is treated as a **1D signal (spectrum)** and expanded into a **4-channel input**:

- Reflectance  
- Absorption  
- Absorption (1st derivative)  
- Absorption (2nd derivative)  

This allows the model to learn both raw spectral behavior and higher-order feature patterns.

## Key Idea

Instead of using a single spectral representation, this project stacks multiple transformations of the same signal:
Input shape (PyTorch):
(samples, channels, sequence_length)

Example:
(____ samples, 4, ____ wavelengths)


Channels:
0 → Reflectance
1 → Absorption
2 → First derivative
3 → Second derivative

## Dataset

This project uses:

**Holt, Z.K.; Khan, S.D.; Rodrigues, D.F.**  
*Spectral Library of Plastics mixed with Environmental Substrates*

### Important

- I did **not** create this dataset  
- The dataset is used for **machine learning experimentation only**  
- Licensed under **CC BY 4.0**

## My Contribution

- Built preprocessing pipeline for spectral data  
- Converted CSV data into **4-channel tensor format**  
- Implemented PyTorch **1D CNN model**  
- Trained and evaluated classification performance
